# hello-world
Projects I've created while learning.
Looking to switch career into a programming based role. Currently focusing on learning Python as an initial language due to it's favorable syntax for begginers. Really enjoy the problem solving element to programming and find watching code come to life exciting. I will be hosting completed projects and problems here with a hope of collaborating and as a portfolio of my work.

Thank you for taking the time to read my waffle.
